# SocialDataAnalysisAndVisualization-28

This project explores social data patterns and FIFA world cup match-related rumor validation using data-driven visualizations and machine learning models. The code is organized across several Jupyter notebooks for clarity and modularity.

## üìÅ Files Overview

| Filename             | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| `DataOverview.ipynb` | Provides a historical summary of World Cup data (1930‚Äì2018), including number of teams and matches per tournament, relationship between number of teams and total matches, and growth of the event over time. |
| `pro_vis.ipynb`      | Contains exploratory visualizations: city-based goal heatmaps, climate-based win rates, and interactive geo charts for host cities. |
| `FP 02806.ipynb`     | The main modeling notebook. Implements the **rumor-based scoring system**, trains logistic regression and random forest models, and evaluates their performance. Includes prediction analysis and coefficient interpretation. |
| `README.md`          | You're here! This file documents the structure and purpose of the repository. |
| `.DS_Store` / `.ipynb_checkpoints` | System files generated by Jupyter or macOS‚Äîcan be ignored. |

##  Project Goals

- Explore whether common football "rumors" (e.g. home advantage, star player effect, climate bias) can be statistically validated.
- Build interpretable models using a rumor-based scoring system.
- Visualize match trends geographically and climatically.

---

##  Usage

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the notebooks in Jupyter or VS Code
3. Follow the steps inside `FP 02806.ipynb` to run the model
4. Use `pro_vis.ipynb` to interact with the data through visual maps

##  Notes

- Visualizations use `plotly`, so they are interactive and best viewed in a notebook or HTML export
- This project is part of a course assignment for Social Data Analysis & Visualization
